## ⚙️ Settings You Can Adjust

### Beam Search Width (1-10)
- **Lower (1-3)**: Faster, simpler captions
- **Medium (4-6)**: Balanced quality and speed
- **Higher (7-10)**: Best quality, slower

### Maximum Caption Length (20-100)
- **Short (20-30)**: Brief descriptions
- **Medium (40-60)**: Detailed descriptions
- **Long (70-100)**: Very detailed descriptions

## 🎯 Caption Quality

### What the Model Can Do:
✅ Identify objects (dog, cat, car, tree, etc.)
✅ Recognize people and their actions
✅ Describe scenes (beach, park, city, etc.)
✅ Detect colors and attributes
✅ Understand spatial relationships
✅ Recognize common activities

### Limitations:
⚠️ May not recognize very specific objects
⚠️ Works best with common scenes
⚠️ May miss small details
⚠️ Better with clear, well-lit images

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

### For Best Results:
1. **Use clear images** - Good lighting, not blurry
2. **Center the subject** - Main object in the middle
3. **Avoid clutter** - Simpler scenes work better
4. **Try different settings** - Adjust beam width
5. **Test various images** - See what works best

### If Caption Seems Wrong:
1. Try a different beam width
2. Use a clearer image
3. Crop to focus on main subject
4. Ensure good lighting in photo
