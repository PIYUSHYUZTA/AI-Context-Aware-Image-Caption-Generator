SIMPLE STEPS TO FIX YOUR MODEL - FOLLOW EXACTLY

PROBLEM: Your model only knows 53 words, so it generates bad captions.

SOLUTION: I will create a script that you run ONCE. It will:
1. Create a larger vocabulary (500+ words)
2. Train a better model (takes 10-15 minutes)
3. Save it automatically

WHAT YOU DO:
1. I will create the script (train_final_model.py)
2. You run: python train_final_model.py
3. Wait 10-15 minutes
4. Done! Model will work better

The model won't be perfect (needs full Flickr8k for that), 
but it will be MUCH better than current 53-word model.

Do you want me to create this script? Reply YES or NO.
